# village_maker
Game where you build your village from tiles

Don't forget to use dynamic feature to improve iteration times:
`cargo run --features bevy/dynamic`

Clippy sometimes weirds out, use this magic line to fix it:
`find -name "*.rs" -not -path "./target/*" -exec touch "{}" +`

Since wgpu now has opengl support, I can use bevy on my old laptop!
